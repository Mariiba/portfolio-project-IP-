        <p>I have always been amazed by the fact a lot is accompllished through technology.<br>
        The fact that the world is evolving every single day technologically, challenged<br>
        me to dare to try be part of the evolution.I want to fit in any field of the job market.<br>
        If I can't treat, fly, teach, guard, design or construct structures and all that,then I can<br>
        just chip in technologically in the software department in all these fields. It will be satisfactory<br>
